The dataset was derived from the 510Global database provided by The Netherlands Red Cross and included data corresponding to 12 typical typhoons in the Philippines over the past two decades. The following are the names of these typhoons: ¡°Bopha,¡±¡°Goni,¡±¡°Hagupit,¡±¡°Haima,¡±¡°Haiyan,¡±¡°Kalmaegi,¡±¡°Koppu,¡±¡°Melor,¡±¡°Nock-Ten,¡±¡°Rammasun,¡±¡°Sarika,¡± and ¡°Utor.¡±The typhoon disaster data included data from 1,034 urban areas with a total of 1,616 observations. In these datasets, we chose to use the number of damaged houses as the basis for the demand for volunteers and assumed that the ratio between the number of damaged houses and the number of volunteers was 1:1.
